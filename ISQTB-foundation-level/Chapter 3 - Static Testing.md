## Chapter 3: Static Testing - Key Concepts

### Keywords

- **Anomaly**: Any condition that deviates from expectation based on requirements specifications, design documents, user documents, standards, etc., or from someoneâ€™s perception or experience. Anomalies may be found during, but not limited to, the review, testing, analysis, compilation, or use of software products or related documentation.

- **Dynamic Testing**: Testing that involves the execution of the software of a component or system.

- **Formal Review**: A review that follows a defined process with formally documented results. It is typically characterized by a structured approach that includes predefined roles, checklists, and procedures.

- **Informal Review**: A review that does not follow a defined process and is characterized by less formal procedures and documentation.

- **Inspection**: A type of peer review that is characterized by the fact that the document under review is examined in detail by the reviewers prior to the meeting. It typically follows a defined process with formal roles, procedures, and checklists.

- **Review**: A process or meeting during which a work product or set of work products is presented to project personnel, managers, users, customers, or other interested parties for comment or approval.

- **Static Analysis**: The process of evaluating a system or component based on its form, structure, content, or documentation without executing the code.

- **Static Testing**: Testing of a component or system at specification or implementation level without execution of that software (e.g., reviews or static analysis).

- **Technical Review**: A peer group discussion activity that focuses on achieving consensus on the technical approach to be taken.

- **Walkthrough**: A step-by-step presentation by the author of a document in order to gather information and to establish a common understanding of its content.

### Static Testing Basics

**Work Products:**

* Requirements documents
* Source code
* Test plans, test cases
* Product backlog items, test charters
* Project documentation, contracts, models

**Value of Static Testing**

* Early defect detection
* Improved quality
* Cost savings
* Evaluation of work product quality
* Verification of requirements
* Identification of problems before dynamic testing

### Differences between Static and Dynamic Testing

* **Static Testing:** Examining work products without executing them
* **Dynamic Testing:** Executing the software to observe its behavior

### Feedback and Review Process

**Benefits of Early and Frequent Stakeholder Feedback**

* Prevention of misunderstandings
* Ensuring alignment with requirements

**Review Process Activities**

* Planning
* Preparation
* Review meeting
* Rework
* Follow-up

**Roles and Responsibilities in Reviews**

* Author
* Moderator
* Reviewer
* Scribe

### Review Types

* Informal reviews
* Walkthroughs
* Technical reviews
* Inspections

### Success Factors for Reviews

* Clear objectives
* Well-defined roles
* Adequate preparation
* Effective communication

**Remember, static testing is a crucial part of the software testing process, and understanding these key concepts will help you apply it effectively to improve the quality of your software projects.**
