### 1. **Narrow Transformation**

- In Apache Spark, transformations on DataFrames or RDDs are either _narrow_ or _wide_.
- **Narrow transformations** are those where each partition of the parent RDD/DataFrame is used by at most one partition of the child RDD/DataFrame. Examples include `map`, `filter`, and `withColumn`. Narrow transformations are faster because they do not require data shuffling across the cluster.

### 2. **Broadcast Variables**

- **Broadcast variables** allow you to cache a read-only variable on each machine rather than sending it with tasks, reducing communication costs. For example, if you have a small lookup table, you can broadcast it to all worker nodes to avoid sending it repeatedly with each task.

### 3. **withColumnRenamed**

- This is a DataFrame method in Spark that allows you to rename an existing column. For example, if you want to change the name of the `age` column to `years`, you would use `withColumnRenamed("age", "years")`.

### 4. **DataFrame Partitions**

- A **partition** is a chunk of data that Spark processes in parallel. The number of partitions determines how work is distributed across the cluster. Optimizing partitions is important for efficient processing.

### 5. **Driver**

- The **driver** in Spark is the process that coordinates the execution of the application. It handles task scheduling, cluster resource management, and also collects the results from the worker nodes.

### 6. **Types of Joins and How to Call Them**

- Spark supports different types of joins (similar to SQL):
    - **Inner Join**: Keeps rows that have matching values in both DataFrames.
    - **Left Outer Join**: Keeps all rows from the left DataFrame, with `null` for unmatched rows on the right.
    - **Right Outer Join**: Keeps all rows from the right DataFrame, with `null` for unmatched rows on the left.
    - **Full Outer Join**: Keeps all rows from both DataFrames, with `null` where there are no matches.
    - You can call joins in Spark using `join()` on DataFrames, for example: `df1.join(df2, "column", "inner")`.

### 7. **Dynamic Partition Pruning (DPP)**

- **Dynamic Partition Pruning** is a feature that optimizes query performance by pruning unnecessary partitions during runtime, which helps reduce the amount of data shuffled and scanned.

### 8. **Relationship Between Worker Nodes and Executors**

- In Spark, **worker nodes** are the machines that perform the computations. Each worker has **executors**, which are responsible for running the actual tasks. Executors run within the worker nodes and handle the processing of the data and return the results to the driver.

### 9. **Slots**

- A **slot** refers to the smallest unit of execution in a Spark executor. Each executor can run multiple tasks simultaneously, depending on how many slots it has available (based on CPU cores).

### 10. **Spark DataFrame API Applications**

- The **Spark DataFrame API** allows you to work with data in a structured form (rows and columns). It's similar to working with data in SQL or pandas but optimized for distributed computing. You use this API for transforming, filtering, joining, and aggregating data in a cluster.

### 11. **Managed Table in Apache Spark**

- A **managed table** in Spark is a table where Spark manages both the metadata and the data. When you drop a managed table, both the data and metadata are removed.

### 12. **Variable Accumulator**

- **Accumulators** are variables in Spark that are only added to and used for collecting information across tasks, like counters or sums. They allow you to track values across your Spark cluster without affecting the distributed nature of the computation.

### 13. **RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)**

- **RDD** is the core data structure in Spark. It is an immutable distributed collection of objects that can be processed in parallel across a cluster. Though the DataFrame API is preferred for most use cases, understanding RDDs is important for low-level transformations.

### 14. **Serialization and Deserialization**

- **Serialization** is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, while **deserialization** is the reverse. In Spark, data is often serialized for communication between executors and deserialized when accessed.

### 15. **Stage Boundary**

- A **stage boundary** in Spark is the point where a wide transformation (e.g., a `join` or `groupBy`) triggers a shuffle. The work is divided into stages, where each stage is executed sequentially, and boundaries exist at points where data is shuffled.

### 16. **Slot, Unit, and Worker Node**

- A **slot** is the smallest unit of work in an executor (one task runs in one slot).
- A **worker node** is a machine in a Spark cluster that runs executors.

### 17. **Data on Disk and Serialization**

- When data cannot fit in memory, Spark stores it on disk. To save space, Spark serializes data (converting it into a byte stream). This serialized data can then be deserialized when needed.

### 18. **Function Closure**

- A **closure** in Spark refers to the variables and methods that must be shipped to executors to perform computations. For example, if you reference an external variable in a transformation, Spark needs to ship that variable's value to all executors.

### 19. **Spark SQL**

- **Spark SQL** is a module for working with structured data. It allows you to run SQL queries directly on DataFrames and can integrate with Hive.

### 20. **Different Join Types and How to Use Them**

- As discussed in point #6, Spark supports various join types (`inner`, `left outer`, `right outer`, `full outer`). Use the `join()` function on DataFrames to apply them.

### 21. **Dynamic Partition Pruning (DPP)**

- See point #7 above. To use it in Spark, you enable it by configuring the appropriate settings (usually handled automatically for SQL queries with partition filters).

### 22. **cast Function**

- The **cast function** is used in Spark to convert the data type of a column. For example, you can cast an integer column to a string: `df.withColumn("new_column", df["old_column"].cast("string"))`.
